The primary objective of the Tastebuds project is to develop a feature-rich recipe application using Django. This involves creating a dynamic web application that allows users to browse, add, and modify recipes. The project's focus is on mastering Django's capabilities, exploring database interactions, and enhancing my proficiency in web development with Python.

# Context
Embark on a culinary journey with the Tastebuds Django app, a testament to my exploration and mastery of Django's capabilities. By leveraging Django's powerful features, I've crafted a responsive web application that seamlessly integrates with a backend database to provide users with a delightful recipe-sharing experience. This project has been an immersive learning experience, enabling me to deepen my understanding of Django's MVT architecture, ORM, and templating system.
